# Students_Performance
Analysed Students Performance Dataset and got really amazing observations
Following are the observations that i think are important. 

1)Parental support can help in achieving higher 
2)Medium level of parental education can help in good GPA but higher level education will change and affect lifestyle of children leading to broader exposure and can affect GPA(decrease in GPA very little).
3)Tutoring, sports, music can help in better GPA
4)Volunteering,ethanicity, age, gender does not affect GPA
5)High absentism can lead to low GPA.
